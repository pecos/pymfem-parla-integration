# Notes: This particular script builds the GPU version of
# PyMFEM, i.e., provides the CUDA support. 
#
# Apparently some features of PyMFEM are supported on versions of MFEM >= 4.5
#
# Before running the script, make sure that the we are on the branch
# of PyMFEM named "mfem_45_dev", since these features are not yet in main.

# To use the conda environment and modules therein, we
# need to source the conda.sh file located in the user home space 
source ${HOME}/miniconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh

# Go to the directory of the project
cd ${WORK}/Projects/pymfem-parla-integration/code/PyMFEM

# Activate the Python environment with the Parla dependencies as well as swig/4.0.0 for PyMFEM
conda activate PyMFEM_env

# Load the modules required for the build
# We don't need to load swig/4.0.0 since this is installed with the Python environment
# Also, loading swig/4.0.0 requires loading gcc/9.1 which is not compatible with the cuda installation
module load cmake/3.24.2
module load gcc/8.3.0
module load cuda/10.1

# Clean the pre-existing build of PyMFEM before executing
python setup.py clean --all

# Now install the library with GCC as the specified compiler
python setup.py install --with-cuda --CC=gcc --CXX=gcc

printf "\nFinished with the build!\n"
